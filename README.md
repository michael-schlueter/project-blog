# Blog Project
> This project is part of the course [Joy of React](https://www.joyofreact.com/) from Josh W Comeau. The challenge was to build a personal blog which uses Markdown for rendering blog posts.



## General Information
- This project was meant to solidify the knowledge gained in the course. This module focused on working with NextJS and React Server Components in particular. Therefore, some boilerplate HTML code and the CSS were provided beforehand as well as several helper functions to work with Node in order to read Blog Posts from the file system.
- Another emphasis was to use MDX to be able to include React components into Markdown code which facilitates the use of widgets in blog posts.
- For animation purposes Framer Motion was used to bring the widgets used in the blog posts to life.



## Technologies Used
- React 18.2.0
- Next.js 13.4.12
- Framer Motion 10.14
- React Feather 2.0.10
- Bright 0.8.4
- RSS 1.2.2
- JS-Cookie 3.0.5



## Features
- Display blog posts
- Read blog posts from the file system
- Render the post content in Markdown
- Provide dynamic widgets to illustrate examples used in the blog posts
- Dark Mode
- RSS Feed
